By analyzing user traffic patterns based on time of day, day of the week, and traffic sources (organic, paid, social, and email), the project will identify peak engagement periods and key sources of high-converting traffic. Through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, the project will enable BrightCart to better align marketing campaigns with optimal traffic times, improve resource allocation, and ultimately enhance user engagement and ROI. The final deliverables will include interactive dashboards, detailed reports, and actionable recommendations for improving marketing effectiveness and operational decision-making.
