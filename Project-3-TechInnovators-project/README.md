## 2. Business Problem Statement
The HR department at Tech Innovators Inc. faces two key challenges impacting efficiency and workforce strategy:

1. **Limited Performance Visibility**  
   Although a performance review system exists, it lacks real-time insights. HR struggles to identify performance issues early or recognize high performers. Interventions are often delayed and reactive rather than proactive.

2. **Inefficient Employee Benefit Programs**  
   The company offers various benefits, but lacks clarity on utilization and return on investment. This results in rising costs and inefficient allocation of resources.

---

## 3. Project Rationale
As the company grows, HR manages a more diverse workforce and increasingly complex benefit programs. Without data-driven insights:

- HR decisions remain reactive  
- High performers may be overlooked  
- Training investments may be misaligned  
- Benefit programs may deliver low value  
- Employee engagement may decline  

---

## 4. Aims & Objectives

**Project Aim**  
Provide real-time visibility to HR managers to enable timely, data-driven decisions for performance and benefits optimization.

**Project Objectives**
1. **Improve Performance Management**  
   Track performance trends across employees and teams to support promotions, development planning, and improvement initiatives.

2. **Optimize Employee Benefits**  
   Analyze benefit utilization to focus resources on high-value programs and reduce underused or redundant benefits.

## 10. Key Insights & Findings
- Average performance varies by location, with Austin leading and San Francisco lagging  
- On-site roles show slightly higher performance, while remote roles remain comparable  
- Marketing is the top-performing department overall  
- Paid Time Off (PTO) is the least utilized benefit

- Investigate lower performance ratings for employees identifying as “Other” to rule out bias  
- Conduct a performance audit of the San Francisco branch  
- Address uneven performance within HR teams by motivating lower-performing employees  
- Avoid cutting PTO, as it is highly valued despite low usage  
- Align benefits with the needs of the 35–44 age group, the highest users  
- Survey employees to understand dissatisfaction with the wellness program  
- Reassess gym membership benefits, as usage is high but satisfaction is low  

---
